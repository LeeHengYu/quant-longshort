# Long Short Trading Strategy on US ETFs QQQ & IWM

## Data Sampling
Traning and test (validation) set from [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/), a commonly-use Python library (2022-23 hourly data throughout)

_Only the hourly data within 730 days can be downloaded from `yfinance` at no cost and I fetched the data at 2023 year end. More granular historical hourly data is a paid resource elsewhere._

## Parameters (# of epochs, hidden layers, neurons, the learning rate of Adam optimizers)
Brute force training the given data (2/3 as training and the rest as test), pick the set of parameters that maximizes the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio performance in the test set period after excluding outliers.
> Result: QQQ_weight = -0.3, IWM_weight = 1.3, hidden_layers = 4, neurons = 60, Adam_learning_rate = 0.3

## DNN model: More details
- Dropout rate 0.3 in between each layer
- L1 regularization (Î» = 0.0005)
- Loss function: Binary Cross Entropy
- Optimizer: Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)

## Indicators as features 
(to do)

## Portfolio
Base portfolio: 130% of IWM & -30% of QQQ (opposite position of IWM)

Long or short position is based on the base portfolio. E.g. if the decision is to go long position in the base portfolio, we take 130% long position in IWM and short 30% of QQQ in terms of the net worth.

## Model prediction output & loss function
The model predicts a binary outcome: if the portfolio will rise in the next hour or not. The output is therefore a probablity of portfolio appreciation in the next hour.

## Decision making on LONG or SHORT
Based on the prediction on test set, select 20<sup>th</sup> and 80<sup>th</sup> percentile of the prediciton results on the test set as the lower and upper decision boundaries. Usually, and as I expect, the prediction probablity distribution will center at around 0.5.
1. If the prediction on the latest tick data is in between, maintain the position. **(No new market order placed)**
2. Else if the prediction is below the lower bound, short the base portfolio (by setting the desired position to -1)
3. Else, long the base portfolio.

## Trading API
[IBKR Trader workstation (TWS)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php) API with [ib_insync](https://pypi.org/project/ib-insync/) API wrapper.

The connection is established via active TWS login session hence no explict token is needed.

## Streamed Market Data
#### US Equities and ETFs
#### Forex

## Implementation & Execution
Run the `implementation_tool.py` as a script. (Make sure the TWS is logged in.)

All orders placed are market orders.

## Trade reports (Some SWE stuff)
[Broadcast](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#send-broadcast-message) a simple summary of the trades to an **LINE channel (official account)**

Broadcast info: TBD

Making Line Messaging API call: to do

## Existing problems
TBD

## To do list
- Existing problems
- Some error handling
- Making the code OO to handle global variables (by making them instance variables, optional)
- Broadcasting summary
- Line API connection and callback code (a separate file that wouldn't be pushed to github)
- Line messages formatting. See [Flex messages](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/flex-message-elements/) for more. (optional)
